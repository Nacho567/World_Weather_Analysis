Module 6: APIs

## **Purpose**
This week we helped create a vacation app that pulled locations via APIs based on a few criteria that potential customers could input. First, customers picked their ideal temperature range, e.g. 70-90 degrees, and were given a list of locations that fit that. Then the nearest hotel was pulled, along with current weather conditions. After that a few locations and hotels could be picked and a travel plan could be created so they could enjoy their much needed vacation.
